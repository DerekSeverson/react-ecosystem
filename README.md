# Getting Started in the React Ecosystem
A list of resources to get on-boarded to the react ecosystem

This guide assumes you already have a good understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

I originally wrote this guide for onboarding new employees into the react/redux/webpack ecosystem, and split it up into parts... You should go through each of these resources and be sure to split the parts up into days or multiple days so you don't get information overload. Afterwards, you might want to go even further and learn about Immutable, Flow, Nuclide, Atom-IDE

- Recommended Browser: Chrome (has many useful react and redux dev tools)
- Recommended Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Part 3: Redux
- If you want to understand where the idea came from, [watch the Flux presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw)
- Watch the Redux course on egghead.io: [Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) - from the creator of Redux, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
- Read the entirety of the [redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/index.html)
- Watch the next Redux course on egghead.io: [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)
- Are you still confused about Thunks? [What the heck is a 'thunk'?](https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-thunk/)
- Familiarize yourself with [Redux DevTools for chrome](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - They do cool things like replaying action history, and state inspection.
- Want to become more efficient with Redux? [Learn about Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect#reselect)
- Building a large application? Learn [The Duck Pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux#ducks-redux-reducer-bundles)

## Part 4: Webpack
- Learn about the [Webpack Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

- [Webpack loaders and plugins](https://hackernoon.com/webpack-loaders-and-plugins-for-your-new-progressive-web-app-378e09f469)

## Part 5: Node.js
You've already been using Node.js behind the scenes in most of these tools. If you want to create your own back end to serve your application, look into Express:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- Before you bury yourself in packages, [learn the Node.js runtime itself](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-bury-yourself-in-packages-learn-the-node-js-runtime-itself-f9031fbd8b69)
- Getting Started with [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
- Many people have switched from `npm` to `yarn`: [Getting Started with Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)

## Part 6: Testing
- [Getting Started with Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) - Delightful JavaScript Testing
- Testing React components with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme#enzyme)
- [ReactTestUtils](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html) - Testing React components in the DOM
- [Redux testing tips](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/WritingTests.html) (actions/async actions, reducers, containers, and middleware)
- [Testing Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect#q-how-do-i-test-a-selector)

## Part 7: Putting it all together
- Try setting up a project from scratch using `yarn init` and then add react, redux, webpack, middleware, other libraries, etc.
- Build out a mini-app using all of these technologies to make sure you understand:
  - How to create react components
  - How to create actions, thunks, and reducers in redux
  - How to create redux modules using the [Duck Pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux#ducks-redux-reducer-bundles)
  - How to make your own server using Node/Express
  - Configure a build process in webpack
  - Use webpack to process CSS and Image files so your entire project builds into 1 js file (or multiple - see Code Splitting below)
  
If you want to see an example, I've created my own [react-app-scaffolding](https://github.com/malechite/react-app-scaffolding) from scratch using all of the above information. (note: this scaffolding assumes you have a back-end that provides a JWT token)
